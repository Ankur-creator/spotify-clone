 HTML Structure Overview:
   
Navigation Bar (<nav>):
Contains the brand name "Spotify" and links to "Home" and "About."
Thereâ€™s an image tag used to display a logo (<img src="logo.png">).
Song List Section (<div class="songList">):
Displays a title Best of NCS - No Copyright Sounds.
Contains multiple <div class="songItem"> sections, each representing a song. Each song includes:
An image placeholder (<img alt="1">).
A song name (<span class="songName">Let me Love You</span>).
A play button and timestamp (<i class="far songItemPlay fa-play-circle">).
Bottom Playback Controls:
Includes a progress bar (<input type="range">), previous and next buttons (<i class="fas fa-step-backward">, <i class="fas fa-step-forward">), and a play button (<i class="far fa-play-circle">).
Displays the current playing song (<span id="masterSongName">Warriyo - Mortals [NCS Release]</span>) and a gif animation representing the playing status.

2. Classes and IDs:
The HTML includes several class and id attributes for styling and JavaScript functionality:
class="songItemPlay" is used for the play button, likely controlled by JavaScript to handle playback actions.
id="masterPlay" is used for the main play button at the bottom, controlling the overall playback.
id="gif" is linked to an animation image (playing.gif) showing when a song is playing.

3. External Resources:
External CSS (style.css): For styling the layout, colors, fonts, etc.
External JavaScript (script.js): This file likely contains the functionality to control playback, update the progress bar, change songs, etc.
Font Awesome: The <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/26504e4a1f.js"> provides icons like play, pause, step-backward, and step-forward for the controls.


Suggestions for Improvement:
Accessibility:
Add alt attributes for all images to improve accessibility for screen readers.
Ensure the play buttons are keyboard accessible (e.g., tabindex="0").

Dynamic Content:
The song list currently shows identical songs ("Let me Love You") for all items. You may want to use dynamic data (e.g., an array of songs) for variety.

JavaScript Integration:
The script.js file is referenced but empty in the code. You'll need to implement JavaScript to control features like:
Playing and pausing songs.
Changing songs via the previous/next buttons.
Updating the progress bar as the song plays.
